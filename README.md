# CSHash
**CSHash** is an open source hashing library made in C#, for making hashing easier. It supports MD5, SHA-1 to SHA-512, RIPEMD-160, CRC-32, and more soon.

# Using CSHash
Using CSHash is very easy, add an ```using``` directive, create an constructor for an digest class (like that: ```MD5 md5 = new MD5();```) and you are ready to go! CSHash also supports awaitable operations for hashing, so GUI threads won't hang up.
